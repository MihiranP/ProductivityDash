### **I'm not lazy, I'm just a little lost...**

I have goals and good intentions, but you lack the structure or mental clarity to make consistent progress—especially after long workdays. That "gap" between what you want to do and what actually gets done is where this dashboard fits in.

### **The Problem**

> I have goals I care about—whether it’s improving as a software engineer, learning something new, or just being more well-rounded—but after work, my brain’s foggy. I don’t want to figure out what to do. I just want something that tells me: 'Here’s your game plan for the week.'
>
> The existing tools I’ve seen are either too broad (like Notion, which is flexible but not smart), or too rigid (like habit trackers, which don't help me figure out how to approach a goal). What I really want is a system that knows my time, understands my goals, and helps me make focused progress one week at a time.

### **The Idea**

> What if I could tell a system: 'Here’s what I want to work on this month, and here’s how much time I have this week.' And it just builds a weekly lesson plan for me—divides up tasks, spreads them across the week, and gives me one thing to focus on at a time?
>
> I want it to feel like a personal productivity coach that doesn’t just nag me with reminders, but actually thinks through the steps for me. It breaks down the goal, lays it out across my schedule, and lets me tweak it if needed.

# Flow:

#### **Step 1: Define Your Weekly Availability**

The first step is to block off times during the upcoming week when I’m unavailable—typically due to work, appointments, or other fixed obligations.

- The interface will show a **weekly calendar view**.
- I’ll manually select time blocks I want the system to _avoid_ when planning goal-related tasks.
- This availability map becomes the foundation for personalized scheduling.

---

#### **Step 2: Enter Goals for the Week**

Once my availability is set, I’ll be prompted to define 1–3 personal goals for the week. These are areas I want to improve or make progress in.

For each goal, I’ll provide:

- **Goal Name** (e.g., "Improve Leetcode skills")
- **Description** (optional – why I care about this goal)
- **Time Commitment** (how many total hours I want to spend on this goal over the week)

Example:

> **Goal:** Grow as a software engineer
> **Time Commitment:** 5 hours
> **Description:** Focus on problem solving and backend system concepts.

---

#### **Step 3: Generate or Add Tasks**

For each goal, I’ll be given the option to:

- **Manually input tasks** I already have in mind.
- Or ask the **LLM to generate a curriculum**—a breakdown of suggested tasks based on the goal and time I have.

Each task will include:

- A title
- A short description
- An estimated time to complete
- (Optional) Suggested resources

Tasks are grouped under their parent goal.

---

#### **Step 4: Auto-Schedule the Week**

With availability, goals, and tasks in place, the system will generate a one-week plan:

- Tasks are distributed across the available time blocks.
- Each time block is clearly associated with a goal and a task.
- Users can see the plan in a **calendar-like view**, with drag-and-drop capability to adjust blocks if needed.

The goal is to give me a realistic, actionable schedule that balances my aspirations with the constraints of my time.

---

#### **Step 5: Execute and Track**

During the week, I’ll use the dashboard to:

- Check off completed tasks.
- Move tasks to other days if something unexpected comes up.
- Add new tasks as needed.

---

### Future Enhancements

In future iterations, I may add:

- A weekly reflection feature to rate my week and reflect on what worked or didn’t.
- Smart suggestions to improve scheduling patterns or goal structure based on past 3 weeks.
- MCP integrations to connect to other calendars / notes like notion
- Reminder integration with Twillo
